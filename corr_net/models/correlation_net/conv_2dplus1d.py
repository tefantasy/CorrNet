    r"""Applies a factored 3D convolution over an input signal composed of several input 
    planes with distinct spatial and time axes, by performing a 2D convolution over the 
    spatial axes to an intermediate subspace, followed by a 1D convolution over the time 
    axis to produce the final output.
    Args:
        in_channels (int): Number of channels in the input tensor
        out_channels (int): Number of channels produced by the convolution
        kernel_size (int or tuple): Size of the convolving kernel
        stride (int or tuple, optional): Stride of the convolution. Default: 1
        padding (int or tuple, optional): Zero-padding added to the sides of the input during their respective convolutions. Default: 0
        bias (bool, optional): If ``True``, adds a learnable bias to the output. Default: ``True``
